-- Question 3. Count records
-- How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

-- Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18.

-- Remember that lpep_pickup_datetime and lpep_dropoff_datetime columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM green_taxi_trips 
WHERE DATE(LPEP_PICKUP_DATETIME) = '2019-09-18' 
AND DATE(LPEP_DROPOFF_DATETIME) = '2019-09-18';

-- 15612

--Question 4. Largest trip for each day
--Which was the pick up day with the largest trip distance Use the pick up time for your calculations.

SELECT MAX(TRIP_DISTANCE), DATE(LPEP_PICKUP_DATETIME) AS DATE_PICKUP 
FROM GREEN_TAXI_TRIPS
GROUP BY DATE_PICKUP
ORDER BY MAX(TRIP_DISTANCE) DESC

-- 2019-09-26


--Question 5. Three biggest pick up Boroughs
--Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown

--Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?

GROUP BY tzl."Borough"
HAVING SUM(gt.total_amount) > 50000
ORDER BY total_amount_sum DESC
LIMIT 3;
-- "Brooklyn" "Manhattan" "Queens"


--Question 6. Largest tip
--For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip? We want the name of the zone, not the id.

--Note: it's not a typo, it's tip , not trip
